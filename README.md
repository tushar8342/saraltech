## Description

The project includes an `index.html` file and a CSS file for styling. The HTML file contains a header section with the title of the webpage, a navigation bar with three navigation links, a main content section with placeholder text, and a footer section containing copyright information. The CSS file styles the webpage with a background color or image, customizes the font family, size, and color for the text, and applies styles to the header, navigation bar, main content, and footer sections. Responsive design principles are implemented to ensure the webpage is mobile-friendly.
